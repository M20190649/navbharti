Clustering is the technique for class identificatoin from the given datasets. DBSCAN is one of the most important clustring algorith. DBSCAN clusters the data on the basis of density, so it is categorised as dinsity-based clustering. It discovers the clusters with arbitrary shapes, becouse in the spatial dataset, cluster shape can be spharical, drawn-out, linear, elongated etc. 
previous work done for this kind of problem, but it is need for spatial clustering to get clusters not only whole data, but at the level of specification and at the level of generalization. For example, discovering clusters of crime events at the country level it generates all the clusters of crime. The specification to generalization clustering of given taxonomy of crimes and datasets is discovered clusters not only discovers clusters of crime at country level, but also it discovers clusters at the lowest level of regions like state level, district level etc.
